# Shop Bridge Ecommerce App using ASP.NET Core and Angular


Hello,

I have used ASP.NET Core and Angular 9 with other best practices.

## Introduction
In this section, you will learn how to build full fledged Ecommerce app using asp.net core and angular 9. 

## How Project is structured 

APIs Structure -- API

Middleware -- 
Here, you will get Custom middleware implementation, extension methods, DTOs, Custom Error Handling and few Helper methods as well.
 
Angular Project -- Client

Similarly, I have added project which holds all repository, interface implementation. This also holds the seed project and data context as well.


## Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1. You can cd into client folder and do npm i to install the packages then ng serve.

## Development server

This project is built using asp.net core 3.1. You need to go to cd into API directory and say dotnet restore and  then dotnet watch run.
